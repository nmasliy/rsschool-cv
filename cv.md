## __About me__
I'm 22 years old. I have 2 years of experience in HTML/CSS coding. Nowadays, my goal is to become a Frontend developer.  To do this, i need to improve my skills with the help of a mentor and learn to work with a team and, of course, practice a lot.

## __My skills__
* HTML, CSS, BEM, Gulp
* JavaScript
* React (Beginner)
* Git

## __Code example:__
```
public static string SpinWords(string sentence)
{
    
    string[] words = sentence.Split(' ');
    
    for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++) {

        if (words[i].Length >= 5) {

            char[] letters = words[i].ToCharArray();
            Array.Reverse(letters);
            words[i] = string.Join("", letters);

        }

    }
    
    return string.Join(" ", words);
    
}
```
## __Work experience:__
1 year HTML/CSS coding on freelance and work with a regular customer. I felt that i was not progressing and wasting a lot of time, so i gave it up.

2 months ago i decided to learn React and chose this youtube course which contains 100 lessons: [React-Samurai](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8). 

After 2 months learning React i start practice and create [weather-app](https://github.com/nmasliy/react-weather-app).
I finished this course a couple of days ago  and continue learning React on other resources.
Besides the framework itself, i learned to work with server(AJAX), promises and other things, which i didn't understand before. I found out about project's architecture

## __Education__
I graduated from college as a software technician. Now I am a 3rd year student at the university in a similar profession. The basis of my knowledge is made up of videos on YouTube and free courses.

## __English__
My english level is Pre-Intermediate (A2).
